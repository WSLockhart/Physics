# Physics

> "Nature uses only the longest threads to weave her patterns, so each small piece of her fabric reveals the organization of the entire tapestry." - Richard Feynman

What is reality, and how can we understand it? More precisely, how can we build a mathematical model to describe the patterns we observe in Nature? This is the starting point for the most fundamental of all the branches of science. On this page you'll find a few of my favorite resources, past projects, and other miscellanea related to the study of physics.

### My Research:

(coming soon!)

### Other Projects / Code:

* **Asteroids**: a Newtonian gravity simulator. Download the [python code](https://github.com/WSLockhart/Asteroids)
* **Particle Mesh Code**: Last spring I co-wrote a particle mesh code for a course in cosmology. The code loosely simulates large-scale structure formation in the universe. Check out one of the final videos [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPW5df8Cvrc)
* **On the Shoulders of Giants**: A project to compile the all-time great pedagogical physics problems. I hope that someday this can be a lovely resource for students and teachers alike. Problem suggestions are welcome! You can see a sample page [here](/docs/TimelessProblems_sample.pdf)
