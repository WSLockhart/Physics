> "The rules of Go are so elegant, organic and rigorously logical    
that if intelligent life forms exist elsewhere in the universe   
they almost certainly play go." - Edward Lasker

There is a nice tutorial starting from the very beginning [here](http://playgo.to/iwtg/en/).

I will add a lot more to this page eventually. For now just go to [surroundinggamemovie.com/play-go/](https://www.surroundinggamemovie.com/play-go/).

If you're in Tucson you can check out the [Tucson Go Club](http://tucsongoclub.com/) which meets Sundays from 4-8pm.
