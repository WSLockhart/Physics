### My Research:

My research is focused on neutron stars. I use computer simulations to calculate the radiation emitted by these stars 
(millisecond pulsars to be specific), and model how that light should look to our telescopes here on Earth. 
By comparing our predictions with new observational data from NASA's [NICER](https://www.nasa.gov/nicer) mission, we hope to put constraints on the size, magnetic field, and other fundamental properties of these near-inconceivable objects. 

I recently started a project to compile the all-time great pedagogical physics problems, entitled *"On the Shoulders of Giants"*. Problem suggestions are welcome! You can see a sample page [here](/docs/TimelessProblems_sample.pdf).

### My film:

From 2012-2017 I directed a feature-length documentary film on the game of Go, [*The Surrounding Game*](https://www.surroundinggamemovie.com/). The project was a labor of love, a worldly adventure, and my attempt to synthesize all the emotions and philosophical questions the game inspires in me. The movie is now available on major streaming platforms - go check it out!
