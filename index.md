# Quotes:

> Henceforth space by itself, and time by itself, are doomed to fade away into mere shadows, 
and only a kind of union of the two will preserve an independent reality.

> The effort to understand the universe is one of the very few things that lifts human life a little above the level of farce, and gives it some of the grace of tragedy.
