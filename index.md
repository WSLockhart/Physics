## Quotes:

> "Henceforth space by itself, and time by itself, are doomed to fade away into mere shadows, 
and only a kind of union of the two will preserve an independent reality."  - Hermann Minkowski

> "The effort to understand the universe is one of the very few things that lifts human life a little above the level of farce, and gives it some of the grace of tragedy." - Steven Weinberg
