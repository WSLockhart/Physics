I recently started a project to compile the all-time great pedagogical physics problems, entitled *"On the Shoulders of Giants"*. Problem suggestions welcome! You can see a sample page [here](https://github.com/WSLockhart/Physics/blob/master/TimelessProblems_sample.pdf).

### My film:
From 2012-2017 I directed a documentary film on the game of Go, [*The Surrounding Game*](https://www.surroundinggamemovie.com/). The film is now available on major platforms - check it out!

### Quotes:

> "Henceforth space by itself, and time by itself, are doomed to fade away into mere shadows, 
and only a kind of union of the two will preserve an independent reality."  - Hermann Minkowski

> "The effort to understand the universe is one of the very few things that lifts human life a little above the level of farce, and gives it some of the grace of tragedy." - Steven Weinberg

> "If I have seen further it is by standing on the shoulders of Giants." - Isaac Newton
