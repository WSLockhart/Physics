Welcome to my website in progress!

### Research:

My research focuses on *pulsars* - rapidly spinning neutron stars which emit electromagnetic radiation. Together with professors [Sam Gralla](http://w3.physics.arizona.edu/people/sam-gralla) and [Dimitrios Psaltis](http://xtreme.as.arizona.edu/~dpsaltis/), I am using computer simulations to model the thermal radiation emitted by these stars. In these radiation patterns are clues to the mysteries of the star's interior, and the nature of ultra-dense baryonic matter beyond the nuclear saturation density. 

By comparing our results with new observational data from NASA's [NICER](https://www.nasa.gov/nicer) mission, expected next year, we hope to improve the known constraints on the size, magnetic field, and other fundamental properties of these astounding objects.

I recently started a side project to compile the all-time great pedagogical physics problems, entitled *"On the Shoulders of Giants"*. Problem suggestions are welcome! You can see a sample page [here](/docs/TimelessProblems_sample.pdf).

### Teaching:

I have two years' experience as a teaching assistant (TA) for the freshman undergraduate physics courses at the [UofA](http://w3.physics.arizona.edu/): 141 (Mechanics) and 241 (Electricity & Magnetism). 

I am a nationally ranked 5-dan amateur Go player, and I have taught Go both in private lessons and group workshops.

### My film:

From 2012-2017 I directed a feature-length documentary film on the game of Go, [*The Surrounding Game*](https://www.surroundinggamemovie.com/). The project was a labor of love, a worldly adventure, and my attempt to synthesize all the emotions and philosophical questions the game inspires in me. The movie is now available on major streaming platforms - go watch it! Or see the [Film](film.md) tab for more info.
