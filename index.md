Welcome to my website in progress!

### My Research:

My research is focused on neutron stars. I use computer simulations to calculate the radiation emitted by these stars 
(millisecond pulsars to be specific), and model how that light should look to our telescopes here on Earth. 
By comparing these predictions with new observational data from NASA's [NICER](https://www.nasa.gov/nicer) mission, we hope to put constraints on the size, magnetic field, and other fundamental properties of these near-inconceivable objects. 

I recently started a project to compile the all-time great pedagogical physics problems, entitled *"On the Shoulders of Giants"*. Problem suggestions welcome! You can see a sample page [here](https://github.com/WSLockhart/Physics/blob/master/TimelessProblems_sample.pdf).

### My film:
From 2012-2017 I directed a documentary film on the game of Go, [*The Surrounding Game*](https://www.surroundinggamemovie.com/). The film is now available on major platforms - check it out!
