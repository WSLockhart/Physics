# The Surrounding Game: a documentary film
---

![film image](/images/TSG.png)

From 2012-2017 I directed a feature-length documentary film on the game of Go, [*The Surrounding Game*](https://www.surroundinggamemovie.com/). 
The project was a labor of love, a worldly adventure, and my attempt to synthesize all the emotions and philosophical questions the game inspires in me. 

[More info on the film coming soon]
